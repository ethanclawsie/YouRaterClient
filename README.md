# YouRater
YouRater is my [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yourater/jaeknakgpdaejbfmdimdpnmmllloifhb) project that I have worked on for my summer internship. This extension provides more in-depth options to reviewing videos on YouTube. Currently, YouTube has a like and a dislike button, but this extension adds a system whereby users can rate videos on a five-star basis. Users can also see the number of ratings each video has, as well as the average rating of the video.
